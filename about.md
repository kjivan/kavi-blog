This blog captures insights for myself. Itâ€™s a journal of ideas that warrant more attention. I also post ideas here to share them with others. Eventually I would like to add the ability to add comments to the site.

The idea of capturing my insights was inspired by a video called The Audience of One.[^1] And the following quote
> Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.

I believe writing my thoughts down will help me to think more clearly. So here I am.

**Theory:** Human brains have evolved with physical survival being the greatest
challenge. However, some of us can now take survival for granted. This results
in an inconsistency between the way our mind operates and our conscious goals.
In effect our mind psychologically lags behind our needs.

I call this theory **Psychological Evolutionary Lag**.

This leads to the fundamental problem with the human condition and society
post-survival challenge.

The articles on this website will expand on this theory or use it as a basis.
You can expect a mix of articles that touch on psychology and philosophy. You
can also expect articles on techniques used to help deal with the primitive
mind.

Understanding the theory and the **why** behind our challenges can serve as a
trigger for change.

Some of the areas where I see challenges with our primitive behaviors are:

- Inattention
- Laziness
- Materialism
- Competition
- Social Conformity
